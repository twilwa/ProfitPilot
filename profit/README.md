## 🌳 Living Summary

This folder contains files related to an AI chatbot and an autonomous agent. The main files are "__init__.py" which initializes and runs the ProfitPilot application, "agent.py" which defines the Agent class for the chatbot, "clarifi.py" which uses the Clarifai model to generate responses, "clarifi_agent.py" which provides a framework for creating and running autonomous agents, "llama.py" which provides a wrapper for the LLama language model, and "main.py" which serves as an interface for running the AI agent in a sales context. There are also utility files such as "tools.py" for processing CSV files and querying web pages.


### `__init__.py`

📝 This file is the entry point for the ProfitPilot application.    
🔍 It imports the ProfitPilot class from the profit.main module.    
📌 The purpose of this file is to initialize and run the ProfitPilot application.


### `agent.py`

📄 The file contains a class called "Agent" which serves as an interface for an AI chatbot.
📦 The class initializes with various parameters such as AI name, role, external tools, etc.
🔧 The class sets up tools and memory components required for the chatbot's functionality.
🤖 The class creates an instance of the chatbot using the AutoGPT model.
🏃‍♀️ The class provides a "run" method to execute the chatbot on a given task.
⚠️ If any errors occur during setup or execution, appropriate error messages are raised.
📥 The file also includes imports for various libraries and modules used by the chatbot.
🛠️ The purpose of the file is to define the Agent class and its associated functionality.
🔒 The file does not contain any executable code outside of the class definition.
📝 The file serves as a starting point for building and customizing an AI chatbot.


### `clarifi.py`

📄 This file defines a class called `ClarifiLLM` that uses the `Clarifai` module from `langchain.llms`.
🔍 The purpose of the class is to generate responses using the Clarifai model.
💡 The class has an `__init__` method that initializes the necessary parameters for the Clarifai model.
💬 The `generate` method generates a response based on a given question using the Clarifai model.
📞 The `__call__` method is a shortcut for calling the `generate` method.



### `clarifi_agent.py`

📝 This file defines a class called "Agent" which represents an autonomous agent.
🔧 The Agent class is initialized with various parameters and tools for performing tasks.
🔀 The setup_tools method adds a set of predefined tools to the Agent's list of tools.
💾 The setup_memory method sets up a vector store for storing embeddings of text data.
🤖 The setup_agent method creates an instance of the AutoGPT class using the specified tools and memory.
⚙️ The run method executes a task using the AutoGPT agent and returns the result.
📞 The __call__ method allows the Agent to be called directly with a task.
🔎 The purpose of this file is to provide a framework for creating and running autonomous agents.
👥 The Agent can be configured to work with or without human input.
📚 The Agent relies on various external tools and libraries for its functionality.


### `llama.py`

📝 The file contains a class called "LLama" and its constructor.
💡 The purpose of the file is to provide a wrapper for a pre-trained language model called "LLama".
🔧 The constructor initializes the LLama object with various parameters such as the model ID, device, and maximum text length.
⚙️ The LLama object can be called as a function to generate text based on a prompt.
🔍 The LLama object uses the Hugging Face Transformers library for model loading and text generation.
📚 The LLama object handles exceptions related to model loading and text generation.
🔧 The LLama object also provides a separate method for generating text with custom parameters.
⚠️ There are commented-out lines at the end of the file that show an example of how to use the LLama object.
🚫 The commented-out lines are not executed when the file is run.
🔒 The file can be extended or modified to add more functionality to the LLama class.


### `main.py`

📄 This file defines a class called `ProfitPilot` which serves as an interface for running an AI agent.
🤖 The AI agent is used for conducting conversations with potential prospects in a sales context.
🔧 The class takes various parameters for configuring the agent's behavior and external tools.
🧾 The agent can be customized with specific AI name, role, and company information.
📜 The agent follows a predefined conversation flow with different stages, such as introduction, qualification, value proposition, etc.
📝 The agent generates responses based on the conversation history and the current stage of the conversation.
📞 The `run` method is used to execute the agent and get the response.
🔑 The agent requires an OpenAI API key for generating responses.
📚 The class imports the `Agent` class from the `profit.clarifi_agent` module.
⚙️ The file also contains a sample conversation history and an example of how the agent generates responses.


### `tools.py`

📝 This file contains Python code for various tools and utilities. 
🔧 It imports modules and defines functions for processing CSV files, browsing web pages, and querying web pages for information. 
📊 The tools make use of libraries such as pandas, BeautifulSoup, and Playwright. 
📁 The file also includes commented-out code for using Gmail and Zapier integration. 
🔑 It defines classes and functions for interacting with Gmail and Zapier, but those parts are currently disabled.
