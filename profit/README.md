## 🌳 Living Summary

This folder contains files related to AI-powered sales conversations using the ProfitPilot system. The main.py file implements the ProfitPilot class, which conducts the conversations by utilizing the Agent class and external tools. The agent.py file defines the Agent class, which sets up and runs the AI agent for various tasks. The llama.py file provides a wrapper class for a language model. The tools.py file contains code for various tools and agents used in natural language processing tasks.


### `__init__.py`

📝 This file is used to import the ProfitPilot class from the profit.main module.
 


### `agent.py`

📝 This file defines a class called `Agent`.
🤖 The `Agent` class is used to set up and run an AI agent for performing various tasks.
🔧 The `Agent` class has methods for setting up tools, memory, and the agent itself.
📚 The `Agent` class uses external tools, such as file reading/writing, CSV processing, and website querying.
💡 The agent can be configured to run in a human-in-the-loop mode.
🔑 The agent can use either the LLama model or the ChatOpenAI model for generating responses.
🔍 The agent uses FAISS for indexing and searching embeddings.
⚙️ The agent's main functionality is provided by the `run` method, which takes a task as input and returns the result.
⚠️ Errors during setup or execution are handled and raised as `RuntimeError` exceptions.


### `llama.py`

📝 This file defines a class called "LLama" that serves as a wrapper for a language model.
🔧 The class takes in various parameters such as the model ID, device, and maximum text length.
🎯 The main purpose of the class is to generate text based on a given prompt using the language model.
⚙️ The class initializes the tokenizer and model based on the provided model ID.
🔍 The "__call__" and "generate" methods can be used to generate text by providing a prompt.
⛔ If there are any errors during the text generation process, an error message is logged and an exception is raised.
💡 The file also includes commented out code that demonstrates how to use the LLama class.
🔒 The LLama class can be further customized by enabling quantization for model optimization.
🔧 The class uses the "transformers" library for the language model and tokenizer.
📚 The file begins with import statements and a basic logging configuration.


### `main.py`

💡 This file contains the implementation of the `ProfitPilot` class, which serves as a central component for conducting AI-powered sales conversations.
💡 The class has various attributes that store information about the AI agent, the company, and the ongoing conversation.
💡 It initializes an instance of the `Agent` class and runs the conversation using the `run` method.
💡 The `Agent` class utilizes external tools and an OpenAI API key for generating responses.
💡 The `run` method executes the conversation task and prints the response.
💡 The file also includes a detailed description of the conversation stages and an example conversation history.
💡 The purpose of this file is to provide a framework for building and running AI-powered sales conversations using the ProfitPilot system.
💡 The file can be customized to adapt to specific conversation scenarios and requirements.
💡 The `ProfitPilot` class can be used as a starting point for integrating AI capabilities into sales processes.


### `tools.py`

📝 This file contains code for various tools and agents used in natural language processing tasks.
📚 It imports modules and libraries for data processing, web scraping, and text analysis.
🔧 It defines functions and classes for processing CSV files, browsing web pages, and querying web content.
🔍 The `WebpageQATool` class allows for browsing websites and scraping relevant text information.
🔧 The `zapier_toolkit` object provides tools for interacting with the Zapier NLA API.
📥 The file also includes utility functions and context managers for file management and directory navigation.
📚 It uses external libraries such as pandas, pydantic, BeautifulSoup, and playwright for various tasks.
⚠️ Some parts of the code are commented out or have incomplete implementations.
🔒 The file does not contain any sensitive information or credentials.
💡 Overall, this file serves as a collection of tools and utilities for natural language processing and web scraping tasks.
