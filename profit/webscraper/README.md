## 🌳 Living Summary

This folder contains Python scripts for web scraping and data extraction. The `main.py` script uses Selenium and SeleniumWire to scout or collect data from a target URL. The `parse_data.py` script automates the extraction of specific data from HTML content. The `scraper.py` script also performs data collection using SeleniumWire. The `setup.bat` file is currently empty and serves as a placeholder for future content.

### `main.py`

📋 This file is a Python script that uses Selenium and SeleniumWire to scout or collect data from a target URL.
🔍 It has functions to set the mode (scout or collect), get a web driver, scout request URLs, grab responses, and collect data.
🌐 The main function takes a target URL as input, reads it from a file, and collects data using the specified mode.
📝 The collected data includes the request URLs and the HTML content of the target URL.
📂 The collected data is saved in JSON format in separate files.
🔧 The script also has command-line argument support to specify the mode.
⚙️ The default mode is "collect", but it can be changed to "scout" using the "--mode" argument.
🔒 The script includes options to disable encoding and verify SSL for the web driver.
📝 The script uses the Loguru library for logging and the argparse library for command-line argument parsing.
🔗 The main function is executed when the script is run directly.


### `parse_data.py`

📝 The file contains a Python script that performs data extraction from HTML content.
📋 It imports necessary libraries and defines file paths.
🔍 The script defines functions to parse HTML content and extract information such as paragraphs, URLs, contact information, platform information, and integrations.
✍️ The extracted information is written to separate text files.
🔎 The script uses BeautifulSoup library for HTML parsing.
📄 The main function calls the parse_info function to execute the data extraction process.
🖥️ The purpose of the file is to automate the extraction of specific data from HTML content and store it in separate files.
📂 The extracted data includes paragraphs, URLs, contact information, platform information, and integrations.
📌 The script can be customized to handle different HTML structures and extract additional information.
🔧 The file can be executed directly to perform the data extraction process.


### `scraper.py`

📝 This file is a Python script that uses the SeleniumWire library to scout or collect data from a target URL.
🔍 It includes functions for setting the mode (scout or collect), scouting the target URL to retrieve request URLs and HTML content, grabbing responses, and collecting data.
🌐 The main function reads a target URL from a file, initializes a Selenium WebDriver, and calls the collect_data function to retrieve the data.
📄 The collected data can be saved as a results file and/or an HTML file.
🔧 The script also supports command-line arguments to specify the mode and target URL.
📜 The script uses the loguru library for logging and the argparse library for argument parsing.
🚀 The script can be executed directly or imported as a module.
