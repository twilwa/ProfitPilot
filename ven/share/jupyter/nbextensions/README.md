## ðŸŒ³ Living Summary

This folder contains three files related to pydeck, a JavaScript library for creating interactive maps and data visualizations. The `extensionRequires.js` file configures the requirejs library for pydeck and sets up a module mapping. The `index.js` file sets up a WebGL context and includes a shader program for physically-based rendering (PBR), with a function for applying the PBR shader to a color. The `index.js.map` file provides an executive summary of the project or report.
