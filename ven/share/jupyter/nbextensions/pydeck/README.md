## 🌳 Living Summary

This folder contains JavaScript modules and a summary file for a project related to creating and manipulating WebGL contexts for interactive 3D graphics. The `extensionRequires.js` file configures and exports a function for loading an IPython extension. The `index.js` file exports a function for setting up a module that includes utilities for working with WebGL contexts, textures, and 3D objects. The `index.js.map` file serves as a concise summary of the project's scope, goals, and deliverables.
