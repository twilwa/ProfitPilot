## 🌳 Living Summary

This folder contains JavaScript files that are used to configure and export functions for working with libraries related to data visualization and WebGL. The files define mappings, check the environment, and provide utility functions. The purpose of these files is to enable the use of certain libraries and enhance the functionality of the global object.


### `extensionRequires.js`

📝 This file is a JavaScript module that configures the requirejs mapping for a specific library.
📦 It maps the '@deck.gl/jupyter-widget' module to 'nbextensions/pydeck/index'.
🔒 The 'strict' mode is enabled to enforce stricter coding standards.
🔌 The module exports a function called 'load_ipython_extension'.
🚀 The purpose of this module is to configure the mapping and export the required function.
