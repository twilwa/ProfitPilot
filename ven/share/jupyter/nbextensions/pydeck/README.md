## 🌳 Living Summary

This folder contains JavaScript files related to a Jupyter widget called '@deck.gl/jupyter-widget'. The 'extensionRequires.js' file is a module that configures the requirejs mapping for the widget, while the 'index.js' file contains code for the physically based rendering (PBR) functionality of the widget. It sets up shaders for rendering PBR materials, supports various mapping and lighting features, and includes a debug mode for visualizing PBR properties. The 'index.js.map' file provides a high-level executive summary of the folder's content.


### `extensionRequires.js`

📝 This file is a JavaScript module that configures the requirejs mapping for a Jupyter widget called '@deck.gl/jupyter-widget'.
🔒 It disables eslint rules for the entire file.
🔧 It sets up a mapping for the widget to the 'nbextensions/pydeck/index' module.
📦 It exports a function called 'load_ipython_extension' that is required by Jupyter.


### `index.js`

💡 This file is a JavaScript module that contains code related to the "pbr" (physically based rendering) functionality.
💡 It exports a function called "i" that sets up the PBR functionality.
💡 The module defines a vertex shader and a fragment shader for rendering PBR materials.
💡 The vertex shader calculates position, normal, and tangent information for each vertex.
💡 The fragment shader applies PBR calculations to determine the final color of each pixel.
💡 The fragment shader supports features like base color mapping, normal mapping, emissive mapping, metallic-roughness mapping, and occlusion mapping.
💡 The fragment shader also supports lighting calculations, including point lights and directional lights.
💡 The fragment shader has an option for unlit rendering.
💡 The fragment shader supports image-based lighting (IBL) for realistic reflections.
💡 The fragment shader includes a debug mode for visualizing different PBR properties.
