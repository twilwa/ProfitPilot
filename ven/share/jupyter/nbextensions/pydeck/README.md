## 🌳 Living Summary

This folder contains JavaScript files related to a codebase that utilizes WebGL for creating and manipulating vertex array objects. The "extensionRequires.js" file configures requirejs and exports a specific function, while the "index.js" file exports a function for working with WebGL and includes additional utility functions. The "index.js.map" file provides an executive summary of the project, outlining its goals, findings, recommendations, stakeholders, progress, and expected impact.


### `extensionRequires.js`

📄 This file is a JavaScript module.
