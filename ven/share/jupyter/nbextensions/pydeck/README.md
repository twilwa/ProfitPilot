## 🌳 Living Summary

This folder contains three files: `extensionRequires.js`, `index.js`, and `index.js.map`. 

- `extensionRequires.js` is a JavaScript module that configures the requirejs library and sets up a mapping for a specific module. 
- `index.js` is a JavaScript module that sets up a WebGL context and includes a shader program for PBR rendering. It also exports a function for applying the PBR shader to a color. 
- `index.js.map` is an executive summary file that provides a high-level overview of a project or report.


### `extensionRequires.js`

📝 This file is a JavaScript module that configures the requirejs library.
