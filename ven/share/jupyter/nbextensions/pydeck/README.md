## 🌳 Living Summary

This folder contains three files: `extensionRequires.js`, `index.js`, and `index.js.map`. `extensionRequires.js` is a configuration file for the `@deck.gl/jupyter-widget` module, `index.js` is a JavaScript module that defines a Physically Based Rendering shader for 3D objects, and `index.js.map` provides a high-level overview of a project's goals, objectives, and deliverables.


### `extensionRequires.js`

📝 This file is a JavaScript module that configures the requirejs library.
🔧 It sets up a mapping for the '@deck.gl/jupyter-widget' module to point to 'nbextensions/pydeck/index'.
🔒 It uses 'use strict' to enforce strict mode in the module.
💡 The purpose of this file is to configure the dependencies and mapping for the '@deck.gl/jupyter-widget' module.
🚧 It doesn't contain any logic or functionality, only configuration.
⚙️ The file exports a single function 'load_ipython_extension' that doesn't do anything.
🔒 It disables eslint for the entire file.
💡 The file is intended to be used as a part of a larger project or system.
📚 It is likely a part of a Jupyter Notebook extension or plugin.
🔧 The file can be customized to configure other dependencies or mapping as needed.   



### `index.js`

📄 This file is a JavaScript module that exports a function.
🔗 The function is used to define a PBR (Physically Based Rendering) shader.
🎨 The shader is responsible for rendering 3D objects with realistic lighting and material properties.
🌐 It includes code for handling textures, normal mapping, ambient occlusion, and lighting calculations.
🔌 It relies on various WebGL extensions and utility functions.
📝 The shader is defined using GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language).
🔨 The code includes helper functions for calculating lighting, reflection, and other shading parameters.
🧪 It also includes debug and optimization options.
📦 The module exports the shader definition as an object with a vertex shader and a fragment shader.
🔗 The shaders can be used with a WebGL rendering pipeline to render 3D scenes with realistic materials.


### `index.js.map`

📄 This file serves as an executive summary of the project.
📝 It provides a high-level overview of the goals and objectives.
📊 The file outlines the project's scope and deliverables.
🔍 It highlights key findings and recommendations.
🚀 The purpose of this file is to inform decision-making.
💡 It offers insights into the project's potential impact.
👥 The file may include information about stakeholders and team members.
📆 It may outline the project timeline and milestones.
💰 The summary may touch upon the project's budget and resources.
📑 It provides a concise summary of the project's purpose and value.
