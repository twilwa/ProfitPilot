## 🌳 Living Summary

This folder contains JavaScript files related to a project involving WebGL rendering. The "extensionRequires.js" file configures the requireJS library and maps a module to an index file. The "index.js" file exports a function for creating a WebGL context and includes utility functions for rendering graphics. It also has a shader program for physically-based rendering (PBR) with support for various lighting and texture features. The "index.js.map" file serves as an executive summary of the project, providing a concise overview of its purpose, goals, and key highlights.


### `extensionRequires.js`

📝 This file is a JavaScript module that configures the requireJS library.
🚧 It disables ESLint rules for the entire file.
🔧 It sets up a configuration for the map property in requireJS.
