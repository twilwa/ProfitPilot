## 🌳 Living Summary

This folder contains JavaScript files that are used to configure and provide support for Jupyter Notebook extensions. The `extensionRequires.js` file configures the requirejs module loader and maps module IDs for easier usage. The `index.js` file provides support for Jupyter widgets and includes utility functions and a shader program for rendering. The `index.js.map` file serves as an executive summary of the project's progress and goals.


### `extensionRequires.js`

📝 This file is a JavaScript module definition.    
🚀 It is used to configure the requirejs module loader.    
🗺️ The `map` property is used to map module IDs to different module IDs.    
🔀 In this case, it maps the module ID `@deck.gl/jupyter-widget` to `nbextensions/pydeck/index`.    
📦 The purpose of this mapping is to alias the module ID for easier usage.    
🔑 The module exports a function named `load_ipython_extension`.    
🔌 This function is required by the Jupyter Notebook to load the extension.    
🔒 The module uses strict mode to enforce stricter JavaScript rules.    
⚠️ The `eslint-disable` comment disables linting for this file.    
💡 Overall, this file is used to configure the requirejs module loader and define a Jupyter Notebook extension.


### `index.js`

📄 This file is a JavaScript module that exports a function.
🔗 It has dependencies on other modules, such as `@jupyter-widgets/base`.
🧩 The purpose of this module is to provide support for Jupyter widgets.
🔌 It contains code for handling different scenarios depending on the environment (e.g., Node.js or AMD).
🔧 It defines various utility functions, such as object property manipulation and class creation.
📦 It exports a single function that takes a parameter and returns an object.
🎛️ The exported function is designed to be used as a callback for module loading.
📚 The module also defines helper functions for working with WebGL rendering contexts.
🚀 It includes a polyfill for the `OES_vertex_array_object` extension.
🔬 The file also contains a shader program for performing physically-based rendering (PBR).
