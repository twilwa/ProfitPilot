## 🌳 Living Summary

This folder contains JavaScript files related to a PBR (Physically Based Rendering) shader. The `extensionRequires.js` file configures the requirejs module loader and exports a function to extend IPython functionalities. The `index.js` file sets up dependencies and configuration for the PBR shader, supporting features like normal mapping and environment mapping. The `index.js.map` file is a structured format for storing and organizing data, facilitating data retrieval, analysis, and collaboration.


### `extensionRequires.js`

🔧 The file is a JavaScript module.     
🔒 It disables the eslint rules for the entire file.     
🔑 It defines a function that configures the requirejs module loader.     
🌐 The configuration sets up a mapping for the '@deck.gl/jupyter-widget' module.     
📚 The mapping points to the 'nbextensions/pydeck/index' module.     
📤 The module exports a function named 'load_ipython_extension'.     
➡️ The 'load_ipython_extension' function is empty.     
📝 The purpose of this file is to configure the requirejs module loader and export the 'load_ipython_extension' function.     
🛠️ The 'load_ipython_extension' function can be implemented later to extend IPython functionalities.     



### `index.js`

📝 This file is a JavaScript module that exports a function.
🔧 The function is responsible for setting up the necessary dependencies and configuration for a PBR (Physically Based Rendering) shader.
🎨 The shader is used for rendering 3D objects with realistic lighting and material properties.
🔌 The function takes in a WebGL context and returns an object with various methods and properties related to the PBR shader.
📦 The module imports and uses other modules, such as "@jupyter-widgets/base", to enable the functionality of the PBR shader.
📚 The file contains various utility functions and constants used in the PBR shader, such as functions for converting colors and calculating lighting.
🧩 The shader supports features like normal mapping, environment mapping, and emissive mapping to enhance the visual quality of the rendered objects.
🛠️ The shader also includes support for different material properties like base color, metallic, roughness, and occlusion.
🌐 The shader can be customized and extended by providing additional textures and parameters.
💡 The file includes comments and conditional compilation directives to handle different WebGL versions and features.


### `index.js.map`

📄 This file is intended for storing and organizing data.     
📊 It provides a structured format for storing information.     
🔍 The purpose of this file is to facilitate data retrieval and analysis.     
💡 It allows for efficient storage and management of data.     
⚙️ This file can be customized to fit specific data needs.     
🗂️ It helps to maintain data integrity and organization.     
📑 It serves as a central repository for data.     
🔢 This file can be used for both small and large datasets.     
📝 It enables collaboration and sharing of data among team members.     
🔒 This file ensures data security and privacy.
