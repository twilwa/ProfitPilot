## ðŸŒ³ Living Summary

This folder contains files related to different functionalities in a programming environment. It includes a JSON configuration file for enabling a Python data visualization library called pydeck, a header file defining the interface for lightweight cooperative threads called greenlets in Python, and JavaScript files for a Physically Based Rendering (PBR) shader, including configuration and dependencies for features like normal mapping and environment mapping.


### `etc`

This folder contains a JSON configuration file called pydeck.json. It is used to enable the "pydeck/extension" in a Python environment. The purpose of this file is to load the specified extension and configure the Python environment to support pydeck, which is a data visualization library for Python.


### `include`

This folder contains a file called `greenlet.h` which defines the interface for the Greenlet object in Python. Greenlets are lightweight cooperative threads that enable concurrent programming. The file provides the necessary headers, macros, C API functions, constants, and types related to greenlets. It is intended for developers who want to understand and work with greenlets in Python.


### `share`

This folder contains files related to a Physically Based Rendering (PBR) shader in JavaScript. The `extensionRequires.js` file configures the requirejs module loader and extends IPython functionalities. The `index.js` file sets up dependencies and configuration for the PBR shader, supporting features like normal mapping and environment mapping. The `index.js.map` file is a structured format for storing and organizing data.
