## ðŸŒ³ Living Summary

This folder contains configuration files, C API functions, and JavaScript files. The configuration file enables and customizes a data visualization extension for Python. The C API file defines the interface for a Greenlet object in Python 3.10. The JavaScript files include utility functions, a shader program for WebGL rendering, and configurations for a project using the requirejs library.


### `etc`

This folder contains a configuration file called "pydeck.json" for a Python package or application. The file is used to enable and customize the "pydeck" extension, which enhances data visualization capabilities. It should be edited in JSON format to ensure proper functionality.


### `include`

This folder contains a file called "greenlet.h" which defines the interface for a Greenlet object in Python 3.10. It includes C API functions and constants for working with Greenlets, as well as documentation and comments explaining the purpose of each function and macro. The file also includes deprecated and undocumented aliases for some functions.


### `share`

This folder contains JavaScript files that are part of a project. The "extensionRequires.js" file configures the requirejs library and maps a module to an index. The "index.js" file exports a function and includes utility functions and a shader program for WebGL rendering. The "index.js.map" file provides a high-level summary of the project's goals, objectives, and deliverables.
