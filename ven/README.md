## ðŸŒ³ Living Summary

This folder contains files related to different aspects of a software project. The "etc" folder contains a configuration file for an application that uses the pydeck extension. The "include" folder contains a file used for working with Greenlets in Python, which are a lightweight concurrency library. The "share" folder contains JavaScript modules and a summary file for a project related to creating and manipulating WebGL contexts for interactive 3D graphics.


### `etc`

This folder contains a single file called "pydeck.json" which is a configuration file for an application that uses the pydeck extension. The file is responsible for customizing the behavior and enhancing the functionality of the application.


### `include`

This folder contains a file called "greenlet.h" which is used for working with Greenlets in Python. Greenlets are a lightweight concurrency library that allows for cooperative multitasking. The "greenlet.h" file defines the interface and provides functions for creating and switching between Greenlets, as well as setting the parent of a Greenlet.


### `share`

This folder contains JavaScript modules and a summary file for a project related to creating and manipulating WebGL contexts for interactive 3D graphics. The modules provide utilities for working with WebGL contexts, textures, and 3D objects, while the summary file provides an overview of the project's scope, goals, and deliverables.
