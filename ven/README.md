## ðŸŒ³ Living Summary

This folder contains three subfolders: "etc", "include", and "share". The "etc" folder contains a configuration file for enhancing data visualization capabilities. The "include" folder contains a header file that serves as the interface for creating and manipulating greenlets. The "share" folder contains files related to a JavaScript library for creating interactive maps and data visualizations, including configuration files, WebGL setup, and shader programs.


### `etc`

This folder contains a configuration file called "pydeck.json" that enhances data visualization capabilities in the current environment. It should be reviewed before making any changes.


### `include`

This folder contains a header file called "greenlet.h" that serves as the interface for the Greenlet object. It defines the structure and functions needed for creating, manipulating, and switching between greenlets. The file also includes functions for setting and getting the parent greenlet.


### `share`

This folder contains files related to pydeck, a JavaScript library for creating interactive maps and data visualizations. The `extensionRequires.js` file configures the requirejs library for pydeck and sets up a module mapping. The `index.js` file sets up a WebGL context and includes a shader program for physically-based rendering (PBR), with a function for applying the PBR shader to a color. The `index.js.map` file provides an executive summary of the project or report.
