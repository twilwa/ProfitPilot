## ðŸŒ³ Living Summary

This folder contains three subfolders: "etc," "include," and "share." The "etc" folder includes a configuration file for enabling the PyDeck extension in Jupyter Notebook. The "include" folder contains a file that defines the interface for the Greenlet object in Python. The "share" folder includes JavaScript files for a codebase utilizing WebGL for creating and manipulating vertex array objects.


### `etc`

This folder contains a configuration file called `pydeck.json` that enables the PyDeck extension for Jupyter Notebook. The file is used to customize and enable PyDeck's functionality within Jupyter Notebook.


### `include`

This folder contains a file called "greenlet.h" which defines the interface for the Greenlet object in Python. It includes headers, structures, and functions for creating, switching, and throwing exceptions in Greenlets. The file also includes functions for managing the parent-child relationship between Greenlets.


### `share`

This folder contains JavaScript files that are part of a codebase utilizing WebGL for creating and manipulating vertex array objects. The files include functions for working with WebGL, utility functions, and a configuration file for requirejs. The "index.js.map" file provides an executive summary of the project.
