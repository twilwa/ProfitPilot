## ðŸŒ³ Living Summary

This folder contains three subfolders. The "etc" folder contains a configuration file for the PyDeck extension, which enables PyDeck visualizations. The "include" folder contains a C API file for the Greenlet object, used for lightweight cooperative multitasking in Python. The "share" folder contains JavaScript files for a WebGL rendering project, including files for configuring libraries, rendering graphics, and implementing physically-based rendering with lighting and textures.


### `etc`

This folder contains a configuration file called "pydeck.json" that is used to enable the PyDeck extension in a project. This file allows for the integration of PyDeck visualizations and can be modified to customize its behavior.


### `include`

This folder contains a file called greenlet.h that defines the interface for the Greenlet object in Python. The Greenlet object is a C API that enables lightweight cooperative multitasking. It provides functions for creating and manipulating Greenlet objects, as well as macros for accessing the API functions and raising Greenlet-related exceptions.


### `share`

This folder contains JavaScript files for a project involving WebGL rendering. It includes files for configuring the requireJS library, creating a WebGL context, rendering graphics using utility functions, and implementing physically-based rendering with support for lighting and textures. The "index.js.map" file provides a summary of the project's purpose, goals, and key highlights.
