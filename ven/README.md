## ðŸŒ³ Living Summary

This folder contains configuration files and code related to the PyDeck and PyGreenlet extensions. It includes a configuration file for the PyDeck extension, a header file for the PyGreenlet object interface in Python, and JavaScript modules for a Physically Based Rendering shader and a module called `@deck.gl/jupyter-widget`.


### `etc`

The jupyter folder contains a configuration file called "pydeck.json" that enables and loads the PyDeck extension for use in the project.


### `include`

This folder contains a header file called greenlet.h that is used for the Greenlet object interface in Python. It defines the structure and functions for the PyGreenlet object, which represents a lightweight concurrent execution unit. The file is meant to be included in other C files that utilize the greenlet functionality.


### `share`

This folder contains three files: `extensionRequires.js`, `index.js`, and `index.js.map`. `extensionRequires.js` is a configuration file for a module called `@deck.gl/jupyter-widget`. `index.js` is a JavaScript module that defines a Physically Based Rendering shader for 3D objects. `index.js.map` provides a high-level overview of a project's goals, objectives, and deliverables.
