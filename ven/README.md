## ðŸŒ³ Living Summary

This folder contains configuration files and code related to various Python packages and widgets. The "pydeck.json" file enables the "pydeck" extension in a Python package, allowing for interactive data visualization. The "greenlet.h" file defines the interface for the Greenlet object, which is used for lightweight multitasking in Python. The JavaScript files in the "jupyter" folder configure and provide functionality for a Jupyter widget called "@deck.gl/jupyter-widget", which enables physically based rendering (PBR) features for mapping and visualization.


### `etc`

This folder contains a configuration file called "pydeck.json" which is used for enabling the "pydeck" extension in a Python package.


### `include`

This folder contains a file called "greenlet.h" which defines the interface for the Greenlet object in Python. The Greenlet object is used for lightweight cooperative multitasking. The file serves as a reference for understanding and working with the Greenlet object in Python.


### `share`

The "jupyter" folder contains JavaScript files that are used for a Jupyter widget called "@deck.gl/jupyter-widget". These files configure the mapping for the widget and provide functionality for physically based rendering (PBR) such as rendering PBR materials, mapping and lighting features, and a debug mode for visualizing PBR properties.
