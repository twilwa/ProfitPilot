## ðŸŒ³ Living Summary

This folder contains three subfolders: "etc," "include," and "share." The "etc" folder contains a configuration file for enabling the Pydeck extension in a Jupyter Notebook environment. The "include" folder provides tools and documentation for working with Greenlets in Python, including the necessary interface file. The "share" folder contains JavaScript files used for working with WebGL graphics, including utility functions and shader programs for rendering physically-based materials.


### `etc`

This folder contains a configuration file called "pydeck.json" that is used to enable the Pydeck extension in a Jupyter Notebook environment. The purpose of this file is to configure the Jupyter Notebook specifically for Pydeck, a Python library for creating interactive maps and data visualizations.


### `include`

This folder contains the necessary tools and documentation for working with Greenlets in Python. It includes a file called greenlet.h, which serves as the interface for working with Greenlets through the C API. This file provides headers, macros, and function documentation to facilitate the usage of Greenlets in Python.


### `share`

This folder contains JavaScript files that are used for working with WebGL graphics. The files configure the module loader, set up the module and its dependencies, and provide utility functions and shader programs for rendering physically-based rendering (PBR) materials. The `index.js.map` file serves as a summary of the document's purpose and key points.
