## ðŸŒ³ Living Summary

This folder contains a file called "greenlet.h" which defines the interface and provides functions for working with Greenlets in Python. It includes necessary headers and defines macros for accessing specific symbols in the Greenlet API. The file also defines constants for the version number and the number of exported symbols in the API. It provides functions for creating new Greenlets, switching between Greenlets, and setting the parent of a Greenlet.
