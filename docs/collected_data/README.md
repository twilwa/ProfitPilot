### `paragraphs.txt`

📄 This file explains the concept of contextual compression in document retrieval systems and provides an overview of the tools and techniques used for this purpose.
🔍 The main goal of contextual compression is to extract and return only the relevant information from documents, reducing the need for expensive and time-consuming retrieval processes.
💡 Contextual Compression Retriever is a tool that passes queries to a base Retriever, compresses the retrieved documents using the given query context, and filters out irrelevant information.
🛠️ Different compressors, such as LLMChainExtractor, LLMChainFilter, and EmbeddingsFilter, can be used to achieve contextual compression.
🔄 The DocumentCompressorPipeline allows combining multiple compressors and document transformers in a sequence to further enhance the compression process.
📚 BaseDocumentTransformers, like TextSplitters and EmbeddingsRedundantFilter, can be used to split documents into smaller pieces and filter out redundant documents based on embedding similarity.
📑 The file also provides an example of creating a compressor pipeline by splitting documents, removing redundancies, and filtering based on relevance to the query.
👤 The target audience of this file is someone who wants to understand and implement contextual compression in their document retrieval system.
💡 Overall, the file highlights the challenges of retrieval, the concept of contextual compression, and the tools available to achieve efficient and relevant document retrieval.
