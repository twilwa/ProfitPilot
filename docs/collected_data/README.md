### `paragraphs.txt`

📄 The file provides an overview of contextual compression in document retrieval.
🔍 Contextual compression is a technique to filter out irrelevant information from retrieved documents.
🔗 The Contextual Compression Retriever passes queries to the base Retriever and compresses the retrieved documents.
🔀 Different compressors, like LLMChainExtractor and LLMChainFilter, can be used to reduce the contents of documents or filter them out.
💨 The EmbeddingsFilter offers a faster option by embedding the documents and query and returning only those with similar embeddings.
🔗 Compressors can be combined in a pipeline, along with document transformers like TextSplitters and EmbeddingsRedundantFilter.
📝 The file also shows an example of creating a compressor pipeline by splitting documents, removing redundancy, and filtering based on relevance.
🗒️ The purpose is to improve retrieval performance by returning only the most relevant information.
🌟 The file provides a concise introduction to the concept and implementation of contextual compression in document retrieval.
